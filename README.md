    version 0.2

##Description
Class/Object that handles custom JavaScript events.
When to use this class ? Was created for these cases in mind:
* easily implement the Inversion of Control (IoC)
* decouple small-medium size projects (not yet optimized for large listeners queues) into modules/files/objects
* event-driven programming in JavaScript (EDP)

##Requirements
* jQuery - only for extend() function
* console.log - change it for nodeJS

###Features - Events
* add your own events and dispatch them manually
* cascade events - automatically trigger an event after another
* loose / strict mode - auto define the events when defining the listeners, or not
* create more events with one call
* limit the number of event dispatches - auto destruct the event after a specific number of triggers

###Features - listeners (callbacks)
* unique ID's - automatically generated or manually defined, each listener have one
* limit the number of calls  - auto destruct the listener after a specific number of triggers
* 3 types of listeners (before, on, after) - order your listeners by groups
* manually remove a listener (by type and id)
* add a listener to the beginning of the queue (array shift)
* custom thisArg and argsArray for each listener (used at call)


Any clone / feedback / help / test is appreciated.

####To Do
* copy the listener callback function, not use as reference
* create internal log function
* make it work with nodeJS (including log function)
* add option to setTimeouts on listeners
* add try/catch blocks and make it more secure
* make error messages meaningful
* optimize it for large listeners queues
* make it ready for requireJS as a module
* option to lock/disable parallel/async event triggering - unable to dispatch if the previous run didn't finished to
run all listeners
